# Disbott

## A bot for Discord

### Command List

You can find the latest command list here: http://disbott.pagu.co/#commands

### Install

To start with you'll need nodejs!

Next you'll want to clone this and then add a `.env` file to the root of the cloned folder with the following:

```
DISCORD_EMAIL=
DISCORD_PASSWORD=
LEAGUE_APIKEY=
LEAGUE_LOCATION=
```

You'll want to fill these in with your own values.

Once that's all sorted you can then run `npm install` to install the dependencies for the bot and webserver.

When that's all sorted you should be able to run `npm run start:bot` to start the bot or `npm run start:web` to start the websever on http://localhost:5000. For making the bot join a server you'll want to login as the user the bot will act as first and then join the server first (an easier way should be on the way soon!).

### Bot Modules

Each command the bot uses is it's own file in `/modules` if you're adding new modules you'll want to create new files (and folders if you're grouping a group of commands) for them. To then add or remove a command from the bot you'll want to modify `bot.js` either adding/removing the require statement & the function within `bot.on(message)`.
