# TODO

- Check ranked status on lol (y)
- Add link to spectate on the current game post // add a new spectate command (`!lolspectate`) that outputs the link to click
- Help command / website (`!help`) (y)
- Post memes
- Set bot's currently playing (y)
- With commands like `!lolcurrentgame=[summonername]` we should also `!lolcurrentgame=@[discorduser]` (y)
- LCS Alerts
- Maybe replace the current game message or add to it with a link to op.gg or something to see the full team. (y)
- Maybe change `!elvis` to just be `!playmusic=[path]` and people can then do whatever. Tie this in with a songdb, register songs and then play them.
- I wonder if the bot can download files sent to it, might be worth doing that when registering songs above
